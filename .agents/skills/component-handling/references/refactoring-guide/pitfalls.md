# Pitfalls

Common mistakes when refactoring components.

| Pitfall                 | Problem                                        | Solution                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Premature abstraction   | Moving to shared "just in case"                | Keep feature-specific until actually reused                       |
| Over-generalization     | One component with 20+ props                   | Split into variants                                               |
| Incomplete refactoring  | Component moved but still has feature coupling | Remove ALL feature-specific code                                  |
| Not updating all usages | Some files still import from old location      | Search imports: `rg "from.*old-component"`, update systematically |
