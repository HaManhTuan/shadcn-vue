# Red Flags

Signs that component placement or structure is wrong. Fix these immediately.

| Red flag                                    | Problem            | Action                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Atoms importing molecules                   | Violates hierarchy | Atom must not depend on molecule. Re-evaluate structure.              |
| Molecules importing organisms               | Violates hierarchy | Molecule must not depend on organism. Re-evaluate structure.          |
| Shared components importing from containers | Tight coupling     | Shared components must not depend on features. Use composition/props. |
| Molecule fetching its own data              | Wrong level        | Promote to organism or pass data via props.                           |
| Organism with no internal logic/data        | Over-categorized   | Likely a molecule. Move down.                                         |

**Import direction:** Only Organisms → Molecules → Atoms. Never reverse.
